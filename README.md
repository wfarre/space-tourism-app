# Space tourism website (frontend mentor challenge)

This is a website designed by frontend mentor. I wanted to learn new technologies (Typescript and Next.js) in a challenge i had already completed before.

## Technologies I used

- Next.js
- Typescript
- Sass

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
